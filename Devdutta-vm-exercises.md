#### Learning Objective

*Create a what-if analysis of impact of shipping costs on profitability. Understand how shipped quantify affects shipping costs.*

#### Context

*In this exercise, we want to understand how shipping multiple quantity of the same product impacts the overall shipping costs. You will be using calculated fields called Shipping (Combined), Shipping (What if), Shipping-Difference Baseline, and Sales. You will use a parameter called "What-if Average Quantity per Order". Your job is to build a combination area chart which will display the before and after cumulative shipping costs by month. By changing the quantity the business user should be able to see how it impacts the shipping costs compared to the baseline.*



#### Steps to be executed by the student (max 6)

*Each bulleted instruction is a complete sentence that describes a specific task.*

- Step 1 - Create 4 sheets to display BIG numbers for Sales, Shipping (Combined), Shipping-Difference Baseline, Shipping (What-if)
- Step 2 - Create a combination chart and display cumulative Sales and Shipping (Combined) with Month-Year on x-axis. Hint: Use measure names in the filters pane.
- Step 3 - Add additional measure of Shipping(What-if) as a dual-axis area chart. Synchronize axis.
- Step 4 - Create a dashboard and add all Big Numbers and the area chart to the dashboard.
- Step 5 - Change title, adjust formatting and colors. Add chart annotations.


#### Exercise question:
*What will be shipping cost savings over baseline if you were to ship 8 quantities?*

#### Exercise Answer:
